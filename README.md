In this tutorial, you will use Terraform to deploy a web application on AWS. The supporting infrastructure includes a VPC, load balancer, and EC2 instances. You will parameterize this configuration with Terraform input variables. Finally, you will interpolate variables into strings, use variables with functions, and use variable validation.
